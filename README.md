# Project Title: OneSearch (Distributed File Search and Transfer System)

## Description

OneSearch is a client-server application designed for efficient file searching, downloading, and uploading across a distributed network. The server component can be deployed on both Windows and Linux systems, allowing for flexible and scalable file management. Clients can interact with the distributed servers to locate and transfer files seamlessly.

## Features

*(To be added as development progresses)*

## Todo List

### Core Functionality
- [ ] **File System Abstraction:**
    - [ ] Implement basic file system operations (read, write, list directories, get file metadata) for local storage.
    - [ ] Design an interface for interacting with different file systems (local, remote).
- [ ] **Network Communication:**
    - [ ] Establish basic client-server communication (e.g., using TCP/IP sockets or a higher-level framework like gRPC/REST).
    - [ ] Define communication protocols for requests and responses.
    - [ ] Implement serialization/deserialization for data transfer.
- [ ] **File Indexing and Searching:**
    - [ ] Develop a mechanism for servers to index available files.
    - [ ] Implement search functionality on the server-side based on filenames or metadata.
    - [ ] Allow clients to send search queries to servers.
- [ ] **File Transfer:**
    - [ ] Implement file download functionality from server to client.
    - [ ] Implement file upload functionality from client to server.
    - [ ] Ensure reliable and efficient data transfer (e.g., chunking, error handling, resumable transfers).

### Distributed System Features
- [ ] **Server Discovery/Registration:**
    - [ ] Mechanism for servers to discover each other in a distributed setup.
    - [ ] Mechanism for clients to discover available servers.
- [ ] **Distributed Search:**
    - [ ] Enable clients to search across multiple distributed servers.
    - [ ] Aggregate search results from different servers.
- [ ] **Load Balancing/Failover (Advanced):**
    - [ ] Explore strategies for distributing client requests among servers.
    - [ ] Consider mechanisms for handling server failures.

### Client Application
- [ ] **User Interface (CLI or GUI):**
    - [ ] Develop a command-line interface (CLI) for basic client operations.
    - [ ] (Optional) Design a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- [ ] **Client-Side Logic:**
    - [ ] Implement logic for connecting to servers, sending requests, and handling responses.

### Platform Support & Deployment
- [ ] **Windows Server Support:**
    - [ ] Ensure server component can be deployed and run on Windows.
    - [ ] Package server for Windows deployment.
- [ ] **Linux Server Support:**
    - [ ] Ensure server component can be deployed and run on Linux.
    - [ ] Package server for Linux deployment (e.g., Docker container).

### Testing & Documentation
- [ ] **Unit Tests:**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for core modules.
- [ ] **Integration Tests:**
    - [ ] Test client-server interaction and distributed functionalities.
- [ ] **User Documentation:**
    - [ ] Document how to set up and use the client and server.
